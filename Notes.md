## Data Lake

Dixon CTO from Pentaho said:
If you think of a data mart as a store of bottled water -- cleansed and packaged and structured for easy consumption -- the data lake is a large body of water in a more natural state. The contents of the data lake stream in from a source to fill the lake, and various users of the lake can come to examine, dive in, or take samples.
